# Chapter 10 - Organizing Production

- Firms must organize their production so that is efficient
- Firms operate in markets that differ according to compettiion
- Firms organize economic activity while markets are used for other activity

## 1. The Firm and its Economic Problem
Firm: institution that hires factors of production and organizes those factors to produce and sell goods and services

### Firm's Goal
- goal is to maximize profit
- if firm fails to maximize profit, it is eliminated through competition or brough out by other firms seeking to max profit

### Accounting Profit and Economic Profit
- Firm's accounting profit is the firm's revenue minus expenses and depreciation
- Firm's __economic profit__ is equal to the total revenue minus total cost, with total cost measured as the opportunity cost of production

### Firm's Opportunity Cost of Production
- Firm's decisions respond to opportunity cost and economic profit.
- Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative use fo teh reso0urce that a firm uses in production
	- includes the cost of resources that are bought in the markt, owned by the firm or supplied by the owner
	- EX: reting capital means the firm is paying rental cost, however if the firm owns rather than seeling or renting, the firm incurs an opporunity cost which is called __implicit rental rate of capital__.
		- The implicit rental rate includes __economic depreciation__ which is the change in the market value of capital over time and the interest forgone, which is the lost potential return on the funds that were used to acquire the capital
		- The return to the own for entrepreneurial ability is profit. The return for input that an entrepreneur can export to receive on the average is called normal profit. The normal profit is part of the firm's opportunity cost. Economic profit is firm's total revenue minus opportunity cost.
			- Economiv profit is profit over and above normal profit.

### Decisions
- In order to maximize economic profit, a firm must decide:
	- what to produce and in what quantity
	- how to product
	- how to organize and compensate its managers and workers
	- hwo to market and price its products
	- what to produce iteself and what to buy from otehrs

### Firm's Constraints
- Firm faces three basic constraints that limit its max profit
	- Technology Constraints: a technology is any method of producing a good or service. At the existing level of technology, a firm can produce more output only if it hires more resources which increases its cost and limits its profits
	- Information Constraints: a firm has only limited information about the quality and effort of its work force, about the current and future buing plans of its customers and about the plans of its competitors
	- Market Constraints: what a firm can sell and the price it at are constrained by its customers willingness to pay and by the prices and markting effrorcs of other firms

## 2. Technological and Economic Efficiency
- typically many different combos of inputs that produce a specific level of output. __Technological efficiency__ occurs when a firm produces a given output by using the least amount of inputs. __Economic efficiency__ occurs when the firm produces a given output at the least possible cost. An economically efficient production process is always technologically efficient. But a technologically efficient process might not be econimcally efficient.

| Method | Labour  | Capital  |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 1  	 | 5       | 10       |
| 2      | 10      | 10  	  |
| 3      | 15      | 9  	  |
| 4      | 20      | 1  	  |

- The table has 4 diff methods of producing a unit of ooutput. The columns show the number of units of labour and capital needed to produce 1 unit of output.
	- Method 2 is technologically inefficient because it uses the same amount of capital but more labour than Method 1
	- Which method is economically efficient depends on the prices of labour and capital. If labour is $10 per unit and capital is $1, then Method 1 is econimcally efficient (with a cost of $60 per unit of ouput). If labour is 1$ per unit and capital is $10 per unitm then Method 4 is economically efficient (with a cost of $30 per unit of output).

## 3. Information and Organization
A firm organizes production by combining and coordinating productive resources using amixture of command systems and incentive system.
- A __command system__ uses a mangerial hierarchy. Commands pass downward through the hierarchy and inforamtion (feedback) passes upward.
- A __incentive system__ uses a market-like mechanism inside the firm.
- The __principal-agent problem__ is the problem of devising
