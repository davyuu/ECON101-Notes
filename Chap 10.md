# Chapter 10 - Organizing Production

- Firms must organize their production so that is efficient
- Firms operate in markets that differ according to compettiion
- Firms organize economic activity while markets are used for other activity

## 1. The Firm and its Economic Problem
Firm: institution that hires factors of production and organizes those factors to produce and sell goods and services

### Firm's Goal
- goal is to maximize profit
- if firm fails to maximize profit, it is eliminated through competition or brough out by other firms seeking to max profit

### Accounting Profit and Economic Profit
- Firm's accounting profit is the firm's revenue minus expenses and depreciation
- Firm's __economic profit__ is equal to the total revenue minus total cost, with total cost measured as the opportunity cost of production

### Firm's Opportunity Cost of Production
- Firm's decisions respond to opportunity cost and economic profit.
- Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative use fo teh reso0urce that a firm uses in production
	- includes the cost of resources that are bought in the markt, owned by the firm or supplied by the owner
	- EX: reting capital means the firm is paying rental cost, however if the firm owns rather than seeling or renting, the firm incurs an opporunity cost which is called __implicit rental rate of capital__.
		- The implicit rental rate includes __economic depreciation__ which is the change in the market value of capital over time and the interest forgone, which is the lost potential return on the funds that were used to acquire the capital
		- The return to the own for entrepreneurial ability is profit. The return for input that an entrepreneur can export to receive on the average is called normal profit. The normal profit is part of the firm's opportunity cost. Economic profit is firm's total revenue minus opportunity cost.
			- Economiv profit is profit over and above normal profit.

### Decisions
- In order to maximize economic profit, a firm must decide:
	- what to produce and in what quantity
	- how to product
	- how to organize and compensate its managers and workers
	- hwo to market and price its products
	- what to produce iteself and what to buy from otehrs

### Firm's Constraints
- Firm faces three basic constraints that limit its max profit
	- Technology Constraints: a technology is any method of producing a good or service. At the existing level of technology, a firm can produce more output only if it hires more resources which increases its cost and limits its profits
	- Information Constraints: a firm has only limited information about the quality and effort of its work force, about the current and future buing plans of its customers and about the plans of its competitors
	- Market Constraints: what a firm can sell and the price it at are constrained by its customers willingness to pay and by the prices and markting effrorcs of other firms

## 2. Technological and Economic Efficiency
- typically many different combos of inputs that produce a specific level of output. __Technological efficiency__ occurs when a firm produces a given output by using the least amount of inputs. __Economic efficiency__ occurs when the firm produces a given output at the least possible cost. An economically efficient production process is always technologically efficient. But a technologically efficient process might not be econimcally efficient.

| Method | Labour  | Capital  |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 1  	 | 5       | 10       |
| 2      | 10      | 10  	  |
| 3      | 15      | 9  	  |
| 4      | 20      | 1  	  |

- The table has 4 diff methods of producing a unit of ooutput. The columns show the number of units of labour and capital needed to produce 1 unit of output.
	- Method 2 is technologically inefficient because it uses the same amount of capital but more labour than Method 1
	- Which method is economically efficient depends on the prices of labour and capital. If labour is $10 per unit and capital is $1, then Method 1 is econimcally efficient (with a cost of $60 per unit of ouput). If labour is 1$ per unit and capital is $10 per unitm then Method 4 is economically efficient (with a cost of $30 per unit of output).

## 3. Information and Organization
A firm organizes production by combining and coordinating productive resources using amixture of command systems and incentive system.
- A __command system__ uses a mangerial hierarchy. Commands pass downward through the hierarchy and inforamtion (feedback) passes upward.
- A __incentive system__ uses a market-like mechanism inside the firm.
- The __principal-agent problem__ is the problem of devising compensation rules that induce an agent to act in the best interest of a principal. For example, the shareholders of a firm are the principals and the managers of the firm are their agents. Shareholders wish to provide incentives to the managers to bring the manager's decision in line with profit maximization. Firms cope with the principal-agent problem in many ways.
	- Ownership: Firms' owners often offer managers partial ownership of the firm to give the managers an incentive to maximize the firm's profits, which is the goal of the owners
	- Incentive Pay: Firm's owners can link managers or workers pay to the firm's performance, such as its sale, to help align the managers and workers interests with those of the owners
	- Long-term contracts: Firm's owners can tie managers or workers long-term rewards to the long-term performance of the firm.

### Types of Business Organization
- A _sole proprietorship_ is a firm with a single owner. This owner has unlimited legal liability, which means the owner has legal responsibility for all debts incurred by the firm up to an amount equal to the entire wealth of the owner. The proprietor is the only one who makes management decisions and is the sole cliamant of the firm's profit. Profits are taxed the saem as the owners other income.
- A _partnership_ is a firm with two or more owners. Each partner has unlimited legal liability. The partners must agree upon a management structure and agree hwo to divide up the profits from the firm. profits from partnerships are taxed as the personal income of the owners.
- A _corporation_ is a firm that is owned by one or more shareholders with limited liability, which means the owners have legal liability only for the initial value of their investment so the personal wealth of the shareholders is not as risk if the firm goes bankrupt. The profit of corporations is taxed twice, once as a corporate tax on the firm's profits and then again as incmoe taxes paid by shareholders reciving their after-tax profits distributed as dividends
- Sole proprietorships are the most common form of business organizations but corporations account for the majority of revenue recived by all types of busniess organizations.

## 4. Markets and the Competitive Environment
- __Perfect competition__ is a market structure when there are many firms, each selling an identical product, many buys and with no restrictions on entry of new firms to the industry. Both firms and buyers are well informed of the prices of the products of all firms in the industry.
- __Monopolistic competition__ is a market strucutre in which a large number of firms compete by making similar but slightly different products. Making a product slightly different from the product of a competitor is called __product differentiation__ and it gives the firm an element of market power.
- __Oligopoly__ is a market strucutre in which a small number of firms compete. Oligopolies might product almost identical or differentiatied goods.
- __Monopoly__ arises when there is one firm, which produces a good or service that have no close substitutes and in which the firm is protected by a barrier preventing the entry of new firms.

### Measures of Concentration
There are two measures of market concentration:
- The __four-firm concentration ratio__ is the percentage of values of sales accounted for by the four largest firms in the industry. The four-firm concentration ratio ranges between near 0 (extremely competitive) and 100 (not very competitive).
- The __Herfindahl-Hirschman index(HHI)__ is the square of the percentage market share for each firm summer over the largest 50 firms (or summed overall all the firms if there are fewer than 50) in a market. The HHI ranges between near 0 (extremely competitive) to 10,000 (a monopoly).
- HHI can be used to classify markets:
	- Markets with HHI less than 1,000 are regarded as highly competitive
	- Markets with HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 are regarded as moderately competitive
	- Markets with HHI above 1,800 are regarded as concentrated
- Concentration measures fail to take account of:
	- __Geographic Scope of the Market__: Concentration ratios define the market as the enture United Sates, but the relevant market might be smaller than the entire nation (newspaper, market is city) or large than the entire nation (autobmobiles, market is world).
	- __Barriers to Enpty and Firm Turnover__: For some industries, a few firms might be currently operating in the market but competition in these industries might be fierce, with firms regularly entering and exiting the industry.
	- __Market and Industry Correspondance__: Some frims products with very specific applications for which few competitors exist, but are classified in too broad of a market (specific pharmaceutical drugs) while other firms have diversified into several distinct product lines and are subject to more effective competition than what their market share for just one product might suggest.

## 5. Produce or Outsource? Firms and Markets
- Firms coordinate production when they can do so more efficiently than a market
- Markets coordinate production by adjusting rpices and making decisions of buyers and sellers of factors of production consistent
- Outsourcing, buying parts or products from other firms, is an exmplae of market coordination

### Why might firms be more efficient at coordinating production than markets?
- Firms can reduce __transaction costs__, which are the costs that arise from finding someone with whom to do business, of reaching an agreement about the rpice and toher aspects of teh exchange and of ensureing theat the terms of the agreement are fulfilled.
- Firms can capture __economies of scale__, which occur when a firm can use specialized inputs to produce supporting tasks.
- There are limitation to the efficiency advantage that firms might have over markets in coordinating resourcse. If coordination through firms is more costly than coordination through markets, markets will coordinate production.

	Economics in Action: Apple doesnt produce the iPhone by itself. Global supply chans, high degrees of specialization and competition, and other innovations have made it possible for a company to design and market a product, collect most of the profit from it, and yet not produce it.
