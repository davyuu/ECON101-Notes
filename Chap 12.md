# Chapter 12 - Perfect Competition

- Firms in perfect competition face max amount of competition because many competing firms, each with idential product
- Firms in perfect competition maximize profit by producing where MR = MC
- Perfect competition leads to efficient allocation of resources

## What is Perfect Competition
- many firms sell identical products to many buyers
- no restriction on entry to industry
- established irms have no advantage over existing ones
- sellers and buys are well informed about prices

- firms operating in perfect competition seek to max economic profit which is difference between __total revenue__ and total opportunity cost of production
- firms in perfect compettiion are __price takers__, meaning a firm cannot influence the market price and it sets its own price equal to the market price
- because it is a price taker, its __marginal revenue__ - which is the change in total revueue that results in one-unit increase in quantity sold - is equal to the market price and is constant as output sold increases. Demand for firm's output is perfectly elastic and demand curve for firm's output is a horizontal line at the market price

## Firm's output decision

### Marginal Analysis and the Supple Decision
- firm product quantity of output for which the diff between total revenue and total cost is at its max because diff is profit
- marginal analysis is used to det the profit maximizing quantity. The firm compares marginal revenue to the marginal cost of producting diff levels of outputs
	- When MR > MC, then the extra revenue from selling one more unit exceeds the extra cost of producing one more unit, so the firm increases its output to increase its profit
	- When MR < MC, then the extra cost of producing one more unit exceeds the extra revenue from selling one more unit, so the firm decreases its output to increase its profit
	- When MR = MC, then the extra cost of produving noe more unit equals the  extra revenue from selling one more unitm so the firm's profit is maxed at this level

### Temporary Shutdown Decision
- firm will temp shut down in the short run when price falls below the shutdown point, which is the output and price that just allows the firm to cover its total variable cost.
- Min AVC is the lowest price at which the firm operates cuz if it operated with a lower price, the firm's loss would be greater than if it shut down
- The firm will continue operating in the short run even if it incurs an economic loss as long as the price exceeds the min AVC

### The firm's supply curve
- as long as the firm remains open, it produces when MR = MC
- the firm's supply curve is its MC curve above the min AVC. At prices below the min AVC, the firm shuts down and supplies zero
	- At prices less than the min avg variable cost, which equals P in the figure, the firm shuts down and supples zero
	- At prices greater than the min avg variable cost, the firm supplies along its marginal cost curve. Hence the firm's marginal cost curve is its supply, indicated in the figure by S = MC curve

## Output, Price and Profit in the Short Run
- the __short-run market supply curve__ shows the quantity supplied by all the firms in the market at each price when each firm's plant and number of firms remain the same. The quantity supplied in the industry at any price is the summation of all quantities supplied by each firm at that price, so the short-run industry supply curve is the horizontal summation of all the firms supply curves
- Changes in market demand influence the output and the entry or exit decision made by firms. An increase in market demand shifts the demand curve rightwards and raises the market price. Each firm inthe industry responds by increasing its quantity supplied.
- Higher price now exveeds eac firm's min ATC and the firms in hte industry earn an profit.
- In short run, there are three pssible profit outcomes-economic profit, zero profit and loss
	- If price exceeds ATC, the firm earns an profit
	- if price equals ATC, the firm "breaks even" by earning zero econ profit. In this case, the firm earns a normal profit. At the profit maximzing level of output, q, the price P, equals the ATC
	- If the price is less than the ATC, the firm incurs loss

## Output, price and profit in long run
- profit motivates firms to enter the industry, increasing market supply
- when market supply curve shifts right, the market price falls. Eventually the price falls to equal the min ATC for each firm and firms have adjusted their plant size so they are producing at the min long-run average cost. At this price, firms in the industry no longer earn an econ profit and so firms no longer enter the industry.
- One diff btw old and new market equilibriums is that the num of firms in the industry has risen and total quantity produced in the industry has increased.
- the effects of a decrease in market demand are the opposite of those outlined above
- in long run, competitive firms earn zero econ profit (price = average total cost)


## Changes in Demand and Supply as Technology Advances

### Changes in Demand
- Tech change can increase demand if it creates new apps for a product or a new product.
- can also decrease demand if new ways of doing things or new products dispace prev ones
	- If demand increases, the price and profit rise. The profit leads to entry which increases market supply and causes the price to fall so that eventually firms agani make zero profit. The number of firms is greater than before the increase in demand.
	- if demand decreases, the price falls and losses are created. Firms exit the market which raises the price and decreases the remaining firm's losses. Eventually the price rises so that the surviving firms make zero profit. The number of firms is less than before the decrese in demand
### Changes in Supply
- New, cost saving tech typically require new plant and equipment. Consequantly it takes time for new tech to spread throught an industry. Firms that adopt the new tech lower their costs and their supply curves shift right. The price of the good falls but the firms with the new tech make an profit.
- Firms using the old tech incur losses. These firms either adopt new tech or exit the industry. In the long run, lal the firms use the new tech and make zero profit.
- changes in the tech brings only temp profit to producers but the lower prices and better products that tech advances bring are permanant gains for customers

## Competition and efficiency

### efficient use of resources
- resource allotcation in a market is efficient when society values no other use of the resource more highly.
- resource use is efficient when production is such that the marginal social benefit of the good equals the marginal social cost of the good

### Choices, equilibrium and efficiency
- consumers allocate their budget to get most value. Consuemrs get most value out of budget, comsumer's indiv demand curve for a good is the consumer's marginal benefit curve for the good. If no one else benefits from the good other than the consumers, then the market demand curve for a good is the marginal social benefit curve
- Firms max their profits to get most value out of resources. Firm's supply curve for a good is its marginal cost curve. If all costs of production are paid by producers, then market supply curve for a good is the marginal social cost curve
- In competitive equilibrium, sources are used efficiently, the quantity demanded euqals the quantity supplied, so marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost
	- The gain from trade for consumers s measrued by consumer surplus
	- Gain from trade for producers is measrued by producer surplus
	- Total gains from trade equal total surplus
	- In long run equilibrium total surplus is maximized
