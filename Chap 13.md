# Chapter 13 - Monopoly

#### Monopoly is a market
- that produces good or service for which no close substitute exist
- there is one supplier that is protected from competition by barrier preventing new entries

#### How it arises
- No close substitues
- Barriers to entry

### No close substitutes
- if a good has a close substitute, even if it is produced by only one firm, the firm effectively faces competition from the producers of the substitute
- monopoly sells a good that has no close substitutes

### Barriers to entry
- contraint that protects a firm from potition competitiors is called barrier to entry
- 3 types
	- Natural
	- Ownership
	- Legal

#### Natural
- creates Natural Monopoly
- market which economise of scale enable one firm to supply entire market at the lowest possible cost
- economies of scale are so powerful that they are still being achieved even when entire market demand is met

#### Ownership barriers
- occurs if one firm owns a significant portion of a key resource

#### Legal barriers
- creates legal monopoly
- market in which competition and entry are restircted by granting
	- public franchise (U.S. Postal Service etc)
	- Government license (medicine license)
	- patent or copyright

### Monopoly Price-setting Strategies
- firm to det quantity it sells, it must chooce appropriate price
- two types of monopoly price-setting strategies
	- __single-price monopoly__ is a firm that must sell each unit of its output for same price to all its customers
	- __price discrimination__ is practise of selling different units of a good or service for diff prices. Many firms price discriminate but not all are monopoly

### Output and Price Deicison
- monopoly is price setter, not price taker
- demand for output is market demand
- to sell larger output, must set lower price
- Total revenue, TR, is the price, P, multiplied by the quantity sold, Q
- Marginal revenue, MR, is the change in total revenue that results from a one-unit increase in quantity sold
- For single-price monopoly, MR is less than price at each level of output

	MR < P

- single-price monopoly's MR is related to the elasticity of a demand for the good
-
- if demand is elastic, a fall in price brings increase in total revenue
- MR is positive
- The increase in revenue from the greater quantity sold outweighs the decrease in revenue from the lower price per unit
- As price falls, total revenue increases

- if demand is inelastic, a fall in price brings a decrease in total revenue
- the rise in revenue from the increase in quantity sold is outweiged by the fall in revenue from the lower price per unit
- MR is negative
- As price falls, total revenue decreases

- if demand is unit elastic, a fall in price does not change total revenue
- rise in revenue from greater quantity sold equals the fall in revenue from lower price per unit
- MR = 0
- total revenue is maxed when MR = 0

- In Monopoly, demand is always elastic
- single-price monopoly never produces an outputat which demand is inelastic
- if it did, firm could increase total revenue, decrease total csot and increase profit by decreasing output

- monopoly faces same type of tech contarints as competitive firm but monopoly faces a diff market constarint
- monopoly produces the profit-maxing quantity where MR=MC
- monopoly sets its price at the hgihest levle at which is can sell the prifit-maxing quantity
- monopoly might make profit even in the long run because barriers to entry protect the firm from market entry by competitors
- but a monopoly that incurs loss might shutdown in the short run or exit market in long run

### Monopoly Regulation

- Rate of Return Regulation
	- a firm must justify its price why showing its return on capital doesnt exceed target rate
- Price Cap Regulation
	- price ceiling
	- rule specifies highest price firm can charge
