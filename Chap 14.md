# Chapter 14 - Monopolistic Competition

- large num of firms compete
	- each firm small market share
	- limited market influence
	- sensitive to avg market price
- each firm produce diff product
- compete on quality, price and marketing
	- quality includes design, reliability, service
- firms free to enter and exit
	- no barriers

EX. Producers of AV equipment, clothing, jewelry, computers, sporting goods

## Short-Run output and price decision
- same as usual

## Long-Run Zero profit
- in long run, profit induces entry
- entry continues as long as firms make profit (P > ATC)
- max profit by producing quantity at MC=MR

- as firms enter industry, each firm loses some market share
	-> demand decreases
	-> decreases quantity at MC=MR
	-> lowers max price
	-> fall until P=ATC
	-> 0 profit

## Monopolistic Competition vs Perfect Competition
- diff
	- excess capacity
		- has excess capacity is procues less than quantity at which ATC is min
	- markup
		- amount by which its price exceeds marginal cost
- in long run, monopolistic competition produces less than efficient scale
	- quantity at which ATC is min
	- operates with excess capacity
- monopolistic comp operates with positive markup

- Perfect comp have no excess capacity and no markup
- perfect elastic demand curve drives result

- losses from excess capacity is offset by gain of more product variety

- innovation is costly but increases revenue
- large portions of price goes to advertising
- advertising might shrink markup and makes more elastic
